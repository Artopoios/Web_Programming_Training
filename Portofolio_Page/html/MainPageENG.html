        <article>
            <p id="introduction_text">
                I come from the greek island of Naxos and I have lived most of my life there. When I graduated from school, I travelled to Athens to study at the University of West Attica in the department of Science and Computers Engineering. There, I enchanced greatly my skills at computers and electronics, aquiring a greater interest in programming and robotics. 3D Printing and Drone development are two of the key interests of mine.
            </p>
            <p id="personal_aim_text">
                My aim is to leave every place that I visit better than I found it. Teamwork, diligence, creativity, and the ability to share knowledge are, I believe, my strongest qualities.

        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <!-- Εδώ μπορώ να το κάνω μικρά κεφαλαιάκια 
        Academic research
        3D Design and 3D Printing
        Hardware Programmer (Drones Arduino Raspberry PI)
        Junior Web Developer
        Art enthusiast 
        -->
        <article>
            During my time at the university I have participated in a couple of research teams. I have worked as part of a team or even as a project manager and I have managed to publish two Academic Papers related to Drones.
            My Hobbies are 3D printing, 3D modelling and lately I exersise the art of marble sculpting when I am in Naxos. Painting in a canvas or 3D figures are also some artistic hobbies I lately love to spend time with.
            I have experience working on a car rental company, by delivering, recieving cars to and from customers and managing reservations.
            I also believe I am self-taught. Two of my latest interests are to aquire knowledge as a Full-stack Web Developer and learn the french language.
            Lastly, during my time in the university, I have teached collegues in advanced mathematics to help them understand and pass successfully their subjects.
